We wondered whether the holiday the movies were written for played a role in this, i.e. do Christmas movies fare better than Hanukkah movies? \nQuestions:\n1: How does type of holiday affect a movie’s rating, and for each holiday, how does the movie’s age affect its rating?\n2: How do movie run times vary over time? Have holiday movies gotten longer over time? Shorter? Is there a significant difference of run time over time? \nPlan: Within our dataset, we will be working with the following variables:\n\nprimary_title - the most popular title the movie is known by\nyear - the year the movie was released\nruntime_minutes - the length of the movie, in minutes\nchristmas - whether or not the title contains “christmas” or some variation\nhanukkah - whether or not the title contains “hanukkah” or some variation\nkwanzaa - whether or not the title contains “kwanzaa” or some variation\nholiday - whether or not the title contains “holiday”\naverage_rating - the average rating of the film\n\nTo answer our first question, we would start by combining the holidays into one column using a pivot_longer function. Then we could compare the different factors, making visualizations and examining summary statistics. We could even use the facet_wrap function to compare the 3 holidays. We will be using a scatter plot with average_rating on the y-axis, year on the x-axis, and holiday as the color of the points. We may also make a bar graph with holiday on the x-axis and average_rating on the y-axis.\nFor our second question the data would be clean, having already wrangled it for the first question. We would make a scatter plot with year on the x-axis and runtime_minutes on the y-axis, even linking color to the holiday! We may also add a line of best fit to each of the holidays depending on how the graph ends up looking, and whether or not there is a clear trend."

    "text": "Your write-up should consist of three parts:\n\n\nBrief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, for instance. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\nThe dataset we chose is the holiday movies dataset from the TidyTuesday repository with dimensions of 2265x14. Our dataset looks at “holiday” movies: movies with “holiday”, “Christmas”, “Hanukkah”, or “Kwanzaa” (or variants thereof) in their title. This dataset has 15 variables, some of which being primary_title, original_title, year, runtime_minutes, genres, average_rating, and whether or not movies contain “Holiday”, “Christmas”, “Hanukkah”, or “Kwanzaa” in their titles.\nWe chose this dataset because we are interested in investigating the relationship between movie types and their public receptions, as well as how elements of movies change over time. We wondered whether the specific holiday the movies were written for played a role in this, i.e. do Christmas movies fare better than Hanukkah movies?\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 2265 Columns: 15\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(6): tconst, title_type, primary_title, original_title, genres, simple_t... dbl\n(5): ...1, year, runtime_minutes, average_rating, num_votes lgl (4): christmas,\nhanukkah, kwanzaa, holiday\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\n\n\n\nThe title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\n\nIntroduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nOur first question was how does type of holiday affect a movie’s rating, and for each holiday, how does the movie’s age affect its rating? In order to answer this question we started by combining the holidays into one column using a pivot_longer function. Then we compared the different factors; the type of holiday movie it is, the movies’ average_rating, and the year it was made (ie. the age of the movie).\n\n\n\nDescribe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nWe then made some visualizations, a density plot showing the average rating density by movie type, and a scatterplot with line of best fit showing average rating by year for each holiday. A density plot is able to show us … and a scatterplot is able to show us …\n\n\n\nIn this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\nOur first plot shows that overall it seems like Kwanzaa movies have the highest ratings overall, but this could be influenced by the fact that there are much fewer Kwanzaa movies in this dataset. This graph also shows us that Hanukkah movies have relatively high ratings, but are more variable compared to Christmas and holiday movies overall.\nOur second plot shows that overall ratings for holiday movies have decreased slightly but have been fairly consistent. It also more clearly exposes a hole in our data for both Kwanzaa and Hanukkah movies.\nThese two graphs lead us to the conclusion that …\n\n\n\n\nSame structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question.\n\n\nOur second question was how do movie run times vary over time? Have holiday movies gotten longer over time? Shorter? Is there a significant difference of run time over time? The variables we looked at in this section were runtime_minutes, year, and type of movie.\n\n\n\nFor our second question we made a violin plot showing runtime by holiday, and a scatterplot showing runtime by year and holiday.
