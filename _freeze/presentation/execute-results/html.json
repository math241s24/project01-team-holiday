Have holiday movies gotten longer over time? Shorter? Is there a significant difference of run time over time?\n  * Our first graph is a violin plot showing density of runtimes based on holiday\n  * Kwanzaa movies short runtimes\n  * Hanukkah next\n  * Christmas have longest, concentration around 90 minutes \n  * Holiday movies in general -> 90 minutes but have a wide range\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2 Graph 2 {.smaller}\n\n::: {.notes}\n* Our second graph is a a scatterplot showing runtime of movies over time, faceted by holiday type\n  * Runtime has increased slightly over the years\n  * Stayed fairly consistent for holiday movies overall\n  * General takeaways\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2 Linear Model {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 Ã— 7\n  term               estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci\n  <chr>                 <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 intercept          -654.       66.3       -9.88   0      -784.   -524.   \n2 year                  0.364     0.033     11.0    0         0.3     0.429\n3 holidays: hanukkah  -23.9       8.14      -2.93   0.003   -39.8    -7.90 \n4 holidays: kwanzaa   -59.2      18.2       -3.26   0.001   -94.8   -23.6  \n5 holidays: holiday    12.2       1.66       7.37   0         8.99   15.5  \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
