Have holiday movies gotten longer over time? Shorter? Is there a significant difference of run time over time?\n  * Our first graph is a violin plot showing runtime by holiday\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n  * Kwanzaa movies short runtimes\n  * Hanukkah next\n  * Christmas have longest, concentration around 90 minutes \n  * holiday movies in general -> 90 minutes but have a wide range\n\n## Question 2 Graph 2 {.smaller}\n\n* Our second graph is a a scatterplot showing runtime by year and holiday\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n  * Runtime has increased slightly over the years\n  * Stayed fairly consistent for holiday movies overall\n  * OVERALL CONCLUSION\n\n## Question 2 Linear Model {.smaller}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(moderndive)\nholidays_lm <- lm(data = filtered_holiday_movies, runtime_minutes ~ year * holidays)\nget_regression_table(holidays_lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8 Ã— 7\n  term                    estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci\n  <chr>                      <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 intercept              -1125.       83.4     -13.5     0     -1.29e+3 -9.62e+2\n2 year                       0.598     0.042    14.4     0      5.17e-1  6.8 e-1\n3 holidays: hanukkah      -314.     1399.       -0.224   0.823 -3.06e+3  2.43e+3\n4 holidays: kwanzaa     -30868.    71303.       -0.433   0.665 -1.71e+5  1.09e+5\n5 holidays: holiday       1216.      133.        9.15    0      9.56e+2  1.48e+3\n6 year:holidayshanukkah      0.144     0.696     0.207   0.836 -1.22e+0  1.51e+0\n7 year:holidayskwanzaa      15.4      35.6       0.432   0.666 -5.45e+1  8.53e+1\n8 year:holidaysholiday      -0.602     0.066    -9.06    0     -7.32e-1 -4.71e-1\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
