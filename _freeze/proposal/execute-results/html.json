We wondered whether the holiday the movies were written for played a role in this, i.e. do Christmas movies fare better than Hanukkah movies? \n\n**Questions:**\n\n1: How does type of holiday affect a movie's rating, and for each holiday, how does the movie's age affect its rating?\n\n2: How do movie run times vary over time? Have holiday movies gotten longer over time? Shorter? Is there a significant difference of run time over time? \n\n**Plan:** Within our dataset, we will be working with the following variables:\n\n-   primary_title - the most popular title the movie is known by\n\n-   year - the year the movie was released\n\n-   runtime_minutes - the length of the movie, in minutes\n\n-   christmas - whether or not the title contains \"christmas\" or some variation\n\n-   hanukkah - whether or not the title contains \"hanukkah\" or some variation\n\n-   kwanzaa - whether or not the title contains \"kwanzaa\" or some variation\n\n-   holiday - whether or not the title contains \"holiday\"\n\n-   average_rating - the average rating of the film\n\nTo answer our first question, we would start by combining the holidays into one column using a pivot_longer function. Then we could compare the different factors, making visualizations and examining summary statistics. We could even use the facet_wrap function to compare the 3 holidays. We will be using a scatter plot with average_rating on the y-axis, year on the x-axis, and holiday as the color of the points. We may also make a bar graph with holiday on the x-axis and average_rating on the y-axis.\n\nFor our second question the data would be clean, having already wrangled it for the first question. We would make a scatter plot with year on the x-axis and runtime_minutes on the y-axis, even linking color to the holiday! We may also add a line of best fit to each of the holidays depending on how the graph ends up looking, and whether or not there is a clear trend.\n",
